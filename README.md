# Command

Command execution for command line interfaces, a component of the [toolkit][toolkit].

This module is a binding of the [define][define] and [argparse][argparse] modules to provide option parsing and command execution for more complex programs. If your requirements are not very complex you may prefer to use [argparse][argparse] by itself.

## Install

```
npm install cli-command
```

## Test

```
npm test
```

## Examples

Example programs are in the [bin](https://github.com/freeformsystems/cli-command/tree/master/bin) directory, there are also a ton of examples in the [test](https://github.com/freeformsystems/cli-command/tree/master/test) directory.

## API

The [define][define] module is thoroughly documented so you should check that
out to learn more about defining program options, if you want to dig under the
hood a little also read the [argparse][argparse] documentation.
